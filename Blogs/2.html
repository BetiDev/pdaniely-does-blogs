<h1>How I started using repl.it</h1>
<p>When I was learning Python I learned about this website. The website name was repl.it. Repl.it is a coding platform that allows you to write and run code in the cloud in more than 40 languages. I use repl.it every day and even made this website in repl.it. Repl.it is not good for hosting website forever. Repl.it shuts down your website 5 minutes after you exist out of repl.it and start it up again when you come back. I usually make my websites in repl.it then export the code to heroku or unubo so it can be running forever. Learn more about repl.it at <a href="https://repl.it/about">repl.it/about</a></p>
